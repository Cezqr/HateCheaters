### (fairly) simple mod which adds API related modules into odin.
Requires any version of odin 1.2.5.beta8 or newer (depending on this mods version. Latest release requires beta 18). Module settings are accessed via the Odin menu.

This mod does not have an official discord. You should use the [issues page on github](https://github.com/SubAt0m1c/HateCheaters/issues) to report issues/make suggestions.
If its a security issue or something unable to be publicised, you can contact me on discord at @subat0mic
